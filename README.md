## ‚ùì How to run this locally

### NOTE:

Before cloning this repo, you need to ensure you have [GIT LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) 
installed on your local system. Because this repository contains several CSV and Model files, 
which are quite large and aren't accepted by github directly. Sorry for this inconvience.

### Steps for running locally:

- Run for Testing, developement or contributing

  As the virtualenv for separating the dependencies, I've gone with 
  pipenv for it. It's really modular and easy to use.
  
  Use `pipenv shell` to activate the virtualenv and then execute the python
  commands to run the files and display accuracy.
